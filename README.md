# Using Open- and Closed-Source LLMs in Real World Applications

![O'Reilly](images/oreilly.png)

## Description

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for the course ["Using Open- and Closed-Source LLMs in Real World Applications"](https://learning.oreilly.com/live-events/using-open-and-closed-source-llms-in-real-world-applications/0636920094342/) by Sinan Ozdemir. Published by Pearson, the course covers effective best practices and industry case studies in using Large Language Models (LLMs).

In this course, you'll explore both open- and closed-source Large Language Models (LLMs) and learn best practices for working with them. Over the course of four interactive hours, we'll dive deep into the world of open-source LLMs like FLAN-T5 and GPT-J, as well as closed-source LLMs such as ChatGPT and Cohere. Additionally, you'll have the opportunity to discuss and analyze real-world LLM applications in various industries.

This course is the second in a three-part series by Sinan Ozdemir designed for machine learning engineers and software developers who want to expand their skill set and learn how to work with LLMs like ChatGPT and FLAN-T5. The series provides practical instruction on prompt engineering, language modeling, moving LLM prototypes to production, and fine-tuning GPT models. The three live courses in the series are:

1. [LLMs, GPT, and Prompt Engineering for Developers](https://learning.oreilly.com/live-events/llms-gpt-and-prompt-engineering-for-developers/0636920094338/0636920094337/#liveEventSchedule)

2. **[Using Open- and Closed-Source LLMs in Real World Applications](https://learning.oreilly.com/live-events/using-open-and-closed-source-llms-in-real-world-applications/0636920094342/)**

3. [LLMs from Prototypes to Production](https://learning.oreilly.com/live-events/llms-from-prototypes-to-production/0636920095639/)

The book [Quick Start Guide to LLMs](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/quick-start-guide/9780138199425) by Sinan Ozdemir is recommended as companion material for post-class reference.

### What You'll Learn

- The differences between open- and closed-source LLMs
- How to set up and configure development environments for both
- Best practices for working with LLMs
- Real-world applications across various industries

This course is part of a three-course series designed for machine learning engineers and software developers.
